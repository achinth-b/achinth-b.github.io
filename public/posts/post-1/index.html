        <p>This year, has been the darkest of my life so far. I lost my job. I lost some dear friends. I lost hope. I herniated my back. I moved back home. In the pursuit of the things I accomplished, <em>I forgot who I was supposed to be</em>.</p>
<p>So I forced myself to think more about what I&rsquo;m doing here. I started writing my thoughts which felt disgustingly difficult at first. My self-confidence has never been lower, and if I don&rsquo;t get comfortable with myself again, I will end up falling deeper into the hole I&rsquo;ve been living in for the past six months.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t force myself to start a blog, then I never will. Even though I have an &lsquo;about&rsquo; page, this is a much more in-depth breakdown of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who am I?</li>
<li>What do I care about?</li>
<li>What do I want to do with my life?</li>
</ul>
<p>So, here goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>I love statistics, mathematics, represenatation, data and computing (in that order).</li>
<li>I am (after a long, often <a href="https://nctr.ca/education/teaching-resources/residential-school-history/">confusing</a>, <a href="https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/pblctns/lssns-lrnd/index-en.aspx">tumultuous</a> and <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/internment-of-japanese-canadians">frustrating</a> relationship with what it meant to be one), a proud <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/learn-about-canada/canadians.html">Canadian</a>. I spent the first seven years of my life in Singapore and had a short stint in India. I lived for a little bit in the United States too.</li>
<li>I am a cultural Hindu of Indian heritage. I was raised in a <em>fairly</em> orthodox <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smarta_tradition">SmƒÅrta Brahmin</a> household.
<ul>
<li>I am <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvija#The_meaning_of_the_two_births">twice-born</a>.</li>
<li>I was raised in a <a href="https://www.hinduamerican.org/blog/4-things-about-hinduism-and-vegetarianism/">vegetarian</a> household.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t consider myself a spiritual person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I play ultimate frisbee. I may not be the best at it, but it&rsquo;s given me so much, such as:
<ul>
<li>how to move on from mistakes quickly</li>
<li>weighlifting, cardio and agility training</li>
<li>some of my closest friends, no matter where I go</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I love playing around with machine learning models and building things on top of them, and perfecting them.</li>
<li>I have come to the conclusion that algorithmic bias and AI safety are going to be my life project. I don&rsquo;t want the issues that we have from our past and present metaphysical condition to carry to the new advancements we bring in pursuit of a better future.</li>
<li>I am a civic market socialist democrat. I like free-market economics, and I don&rsquo;t like how we got to this point in the human condition where we allowed ourselves to be exploited more. I&rsquo;m interested in building a stronger, more united and resilient Canada through welfare state to raise the floor for every Canadian.</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t made peace with the fact that I want to do it all. Maybe I will get there someday.</li>
<li>I love trains. I love taking the subway. I love public transit. I love riding my bike wherever it can take me. I despise cars and hate being forced to drive.</li>
<li>I hate the McMansions that a stereotypical settled-down dream is associated with. I am a <a href="https://www.housingisahumanright.org/what-is-a-yimby-hint-its-not-good/">YIMBY</a>.</li>
