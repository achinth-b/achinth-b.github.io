        <p>Last week, I had a riveting discussion for an hour with <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/brendan-samek">Brendan Samek</a> on the <a href="https://www.buildcanada.com">Build Canada</a> Discord server. This was arguably the most thought-provoking discussion I&rsquo;ve had with <em>anyone</em> in recent memory.</p>
<p>Brendan, the ever-present host of the call, asked me a two-part question that really got my gears turning. it was a simple one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what does Canada mean to you? what does it mean to be Canadian?</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though I was able to give my visceral, albeit poorly strung, thoughts on the matter, this question forced me to reconcile my relationship with my country, and I&rsquo;m extremely glad to share with you, the most refined interface I have with my sense of nationalism.</p>
<p>But before that, I think we need a quick primer on wat it means to be a &rsquo;nation&rsquo;, a &rsquo;nation-state&rsquo;, a &lsquo;post-national state&rsquo; (which I rejec for us, by the way).</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-nation">what is a nation?</h2>
<p>While there is no conventially agreed upon defintion for what makes a nation (I mean, people literaly fight wars over this), I think the best defintion of a nation is what I have come up with by syncretizing multiple sources:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a nation is a politically motivated and organizationally flexible form of social organization where a collective identity has emerged from a combination of shared social features across a given population including but not limited to: language, culture, history, ethnicity, religion, culture, territory or society.</p></blockquote>
<p>To me, Canada represents the world&rsquo;s most ambitious and successful experiment in fostering  pragmatic, collaborative and most importantly, non-zero-sum social organization.</p>
