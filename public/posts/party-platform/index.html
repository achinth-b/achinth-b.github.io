        <p>TL;DR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pragmatic, not performative.
Outcomes, not actions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Canadian federal politics has become performative. The Spring 2025 election was a <em>relative</em> breath of fresh air when compared to the elections that we had in 2021, 2019 and 2015. Reader, I know what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! He&rsquo;s just cherrypicking the elections where the Liberals won and the Conservatives lost! He just wants Stephen Harper back! Fuck this guy!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, no. I am a market social democrat. I have only ever voted for the NDP and the Liberals (thanks to the collapse of the NDP in 2025).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my observation: the problem with Canadian politics isn&rsquo;t <em>which</em> party wins-it&rsquo;s <em>how</em> they govern. We&rsquo;ve turned policy-making into political theater. Politicians announce actions instead of targeting outcomes. They prioritize what <em>sounds</em> good over what <em>works</em>. And when pressed on results, they point to legislation passed, summits attended, and committees formed-as if process is the same as progress.</p>
<p>This document is different. For every issue below, I&rsquo;ll identify the frustration-what&rsquo;s broken, why current approaches fail, and then propose surgical policy changes designed to deliver measurable outcomes. Just pragmatic solutions that other countries have proven work, adapted for Canadian realities.</p>
<p><strong>the structure:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>recruitment</strong> - how to solve Canada&rsquo;s political talent crisis</li>
<li><strong>economic policy</strong> - building sovereign, socialized wealth</li>
<li><strong>international policy</strong> - navigating a post-american world order</li>
<li><strong>domestic policy</strong> - healthcare reform, education and labour-government cooperation</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>why start with recruitment?</strong> Because the policies that follow - building a trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund, transforming healthcare, deepening partnerships - are impossible without expertise; which canada&rsquo;s political class currently lacks. Other countries have done these things. The difference isn&rsquo;t resources or systems, it&rsquo;s leadership quality.</p>
<p>To me, recruitment isn&rsquo;t separate from policy. It&rsquo;s the foundation.</p>

<h3 id="frustration-brain-drain-meets-political-mediocrity">frustration: brain drain meets political mediocrity</h3>
<p>We produce some of the world&rsquo;s most educated citizens<sup><a href="https://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=CAN&amp;treshold=10&amp;topic=EO">[1]</a></sup>. Our universities rank among the best globally. Our STEM graduates, policy thinkers, and business leaders are highly sought after internationally. Yet we face a paradox: while our best minds flow south to silicon valley, wall street, and washington&rsquo;s think tanks, our political class increasingly consists of career politicians, party operatives, and those who&rsquo;ve never built anything impactful outside the political bubble.</p>
<p><strong>the current reality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>350,000+ canadian university graduates annually, among the highest per-capita rates globally</li>
<li>50,000+ canadian professionals work in the us tech sector alone</li>
<li>top canadian talent is recruited aggressively by american firms offering 2-3x canadian salaries</li>
<li>our brightest doctors, engineers, researchers, and entrepreneurs see politics as a career dead-end</li>
<li>meanwhile, political recruitment happens through party backrooms, riding associations, and who-you-know networks</li>
<li>the result: a political class disconnected from the expertise needed to govern an advanced nation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>what we lose:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a 30-year-old Canadian AI researcher leaves for a frontier lab (never considers public service)</li>
<li>a healthcare administrator with innovative delivery models stays in the private sector (politics seems dysfunctional)</li>
<li>a climate scientist with transformative ideas watches politicians debate ideology while lacking technical depth</li>
<li>an economist who understands monetary policy sees parliament as performative theater</li>
</ul>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t just brain drain to other countries. it&rsquo;s brain drain from the public sphere entirely.</p>
<h3 id="policy-systematic-talent-identification-and-development">policy: systematic talent identification and development</h3>
<p>rather than waiting for ambitious people to seek political careers, we must actively identify, recruit, and develop Canada&rsquo;s best minds for public service. this requires a comprehensive pipeline from education through political leadership.</p>
<h4 id="pillar-1-the-canadian-public-service-scholars-program-cpss">pillar 1: the canadian public service scholars program (cpss)</h4>
<p><strong>structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>identify top 10000 graduating canadian high school students annually (academic excellence, leadership, civic engagement)</li>
<li>offer comprehensive scholarships: full tuition + $25,000 annual stipend + summer enrichment</li>
<li>can attend any canadian university in any field (we need diverse expertise, not just political science majors)</li>
<li>bond requirement: 5 years civil service after graduation</li>
<li>no requirement to join our party, but exposure to pragmatic governance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>the pipeline:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>years 1-4 (university):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>academic excellence in chosen field</li>
<li>summer internships rotating through federal ministries, provincial governments, crown corporations</li>
<li>mentorship from senior civil servants and political leaders</li>
<li>policy workshops and governance seminars</li>
<li>international exchanges with peer democracies</li>
<li>build network of future leaders across disciplines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>years 5-9 (public service bond):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>placement in federal/provincial government matching their expertise</li>
<li>rotational programs exposing them to multiple policy areas</li>
<li>fast-track advancement based on merit and results</li>
<li>continued education support (graduate degrees, professional development)</li>
<li>identification of those with political aptitude and interest</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>years 10+ (political pathway for interested scholars):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>those interested in elected politics offered party positions, policy roles, or candidacy</li>
<li>others continue in senior civil service, think tanks, or return to private sector (but with public service ethos)</li>
<li>we&rsquo;ve identified and developed talent; not all become politicians, but all serve Canada</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>why this works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>captures talent before brain drain occurs (age 18, not 30)</li>
<li>provides financial security removing barriers for talented students from non-privileged backgrounds</li>
<li>builds deep expertise in actual policy domains, not just political games</li>
<li>creates a pipeline of potential candidates with proven competence</li>
<li>exposes best minds to public service as viable, prestigious career path</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pillar-2-mid-career-professional-recruitment-program">pillar 2: mid-career professional recruitment program</h4>
<p><strong>frustration:</strong> many of canada&rsquo;s most accomplished professionals never consider politics until their 50s or 60s, if at all. by then, they&rsquo;ve built lives and careers that make political service difficult. we need to recruit them in their 30s and early 40s, when they&rsquo;ve proven themselves but remain energetic and adaptable.</p>
<p><strong>target profiles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>doctors who&rsquo;ve improved hospital systems</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>flexible pathways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>not everyone needs to run for parliament immediately</li>
<li>offer appointments to policy advisory roles, crown corporation boards, expert commissions</li>
<li>build comfort with public service before electoral politics</li>
<li>when ready, support candidacy in winnable ridings (not sacrificial lamb nominations)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>support structures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>financial bridge:</strong> guarantee matching previous salary for first term (removes financial barrier)</li>
<li><strong>family support:</strong> childcare assistance, spousal employment support, housing in ottawa and riding</li>
<li><strong>skills training:</strong> media training, constituent services, parliamentary procedure</li>
<li><strong>mentorship:</strong> pair with experienced members who can guide transition</li>
<li><strong>failure safety net:</strong> if they lose election or leave politics, help them return to previous career</li>

<p><strong>&ldquo;how are you going to have a working-class movement led by elite experts?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>this is the most important question. here&rsquo;s the answer:</p>
<p><strong>we&rsquo;re recruiting experts to implement a working-class agenda, not define it.</strong></p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a critical difference between:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>political direction:</strong> what should we do? whose interests do we serve? what are our values and priorities?</li>
<li><strong>technical implementation:</strong> how do we actually execute those priorities? what specific mechanisms and policies work?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>working people define the direction. experts execute the implementation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>the model:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>policy priorities come from working-class representation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>strong labour representation in party governance (see domestic policy section below)</li>
<li>mandatory consultations with unions, community organizations, worker cooperatives</li>
<li>working-class voices on every major policy committee</li>
<li>caucus must include union organizers, trades workers, nurses, teachers-not just professionals</li>
<li>workers tell us: &ldquo;we need affordable housing, secure jobs, healthcare access, retirement dignity&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>experts figure out how to deliver those priorities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>workers say: &ldquo;we need secure retirements&rdquo;</li>
<li>economists/financial experts design sovereign wealth fund and mandatory savings system</li>
<li>workers say: &ldquo;we need healthcare without going broke&rdquo;</li>
<li>healthcare administrators design efficient mixed-financing model</li>
<li>workers say: &ldquo;we need good jobs, not just any jobs&rdquo;</li>
<li>labour economists and union organizers design tripartite industrial policy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>workers maintain oversight and veto power:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>expert proposals go back to worker representatives for approval</li>
<li>&ldquo;this achieves our goal&rdquo; or &ldquo;this doesn&rsquo;t serve us, try again&rdquo;</li>
<li>experts are servants, not masters</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>concrete mechanisms:</strong></p>
<p><strong>working-class representation in party structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>40% minimum of party executive committee must be current or former union members</li>
<li>30% minimum of candidates in winnable ridings must have working-class backgrounds (trades, service workers, nurses, teachers, not just lawyers and consultants)</li>
<li>policy committees require labour representation</li>
<li>major policy decisions require sign-off from labour caucus</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>community policy councils:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>establish regional councils in working-class communities</li>
<li>members: union locals, tenant associations, community organizations, worker co-ops</li>
<li>meet quarterly with party leadership</li>
<li>power to propose policy priorities and veto proposals that don&rsquo;t serve working people</li>
<li>funded by party, not beholden to it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>the scholarship program includes working-class kids:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>50% of canadian public service scholars must be from families earning below median income</li>
<li>many will be children of factory workers, truck drivers, retail workers, healthcare aides</li>
<li>they get elite education and expertise, but remember where they came from</li>
<li>this is about opening doors for working-class youth, not just recruiting existing elites</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>union members get special recruitment track:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>active recruitment of union organizers and shop stewards</li>
<li>these are working people with leadership skills and political understanding</li>
<li>they know workplace reality, not just theory</li>
<li>bring them into parliament, not just as labour critics but as finance critics, trade critics, innovation critics</li>
<li>you can be a former auto worker AND understand sovereign wealth funds (with proper support and training)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>the difference from liberal elitism:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>liberals recruit elites who condescend to working people (&ldquo;we know what&rsquo;s best for you&rdquo;)</li>
<li>we recruit elites who serve working people (&ldquo;you tell us what you need, we&rsquo;ll figure out how to deliver it&rdquo;)</li>
<li>liberals keep workers as voters and photo-ops</li>
<li>we give workers governance power and policy veto</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>examples in practice:</strong></p>
<p><strong>elite-led liberal approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>phd economist: &ldquo;we should means-test benefits because fiscal efficiency&rdquo;</li>
<li>worker: &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s stigmatizing and I need help too&rdquo;</li>
<li>liberal: &ldquo;sorry, the experts have decided&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>working-class-directed expert implementation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>worker: &ldquo;we need secure retirements that don&rsquo;t depend on stock market gambling&rdquo;</li>
<li>expert: &ldquo;here are three models: sovereign wealth fund, expanded cpp, mandatory savings&rdquo;</li>
<li>worker: &ldquo;we like the mandatory savings because we control our own accounts&rdquo;</li>
<li>expert: &ldquo;okay, here&rsquo;s how we build that system&rdquo;</li>
<li>worker: &ldquo;looks good, but increase the government match for low earners&rdquo;</li>
<li>expert: &ldquo;done, here&rsquo;s the revised model&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>why this isn&rsquo;t contradictory:</strong></p>
<p>governing a modern economy is genuinely complex. you need people who understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>monetary policy and inflation dynamics</li>
<li>international trade law and supply chain management</li>
<li>healthcare financing and insurance markets</li>
<li>investment fund management and risk diversification</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>but complexity doesn&rsquo;t mean working people should be excluded from power.</strong></p>
<p>it means we need two things simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>working-class political power:</strong> setting priorities, making final decisions, maintaining oversight</li>
<li><strong>expert technical capacity:</strong> designing systems that actually achieve those priorities</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>the failure of both extremes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>technocracy without democracy:</strong> experts decide everything, working people get nothing (this is liberal elitism)</li>
<li><strong>populism without expertise:</strong> good intentions, terrible execution, policies fail, working people still get nothing (this is left-wing fantasy)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>we need democratic control + technical competence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>the analogy:</strong>
when you&rsquo;re sick, you tell your doctor: &ldquo;i want to live, i want to stop hurting, i want to care for my family&rdquo;
the doctor doesn&rsquo;t tell you whether those are the right goals.
but you also don&rsquo;t perform your own surgery.
the doctor uses their expertise to achieve YOUR goals.
and you can fire the doctor if they&rsquo;re not serving you.</p>
<p><strong>that&rsquo;s the model:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>working people are the patients (but with full political power, not passive recipients)</li>
<li>experts are the doctors (but servants, not masters)</li>
<li>workers define health (political priorities)</li>
<li>experts deliver health (policy implementation)</li>
<li>workers maintain oversight and can fire experts who don&rsquo;t serve them</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>this is democratic socialism:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>democratic: working people hold political power and define priorities</li>
<li>socialism: economic policy serves working people, not capital</li>
<li>pragmatic: we actually deliver results, not just rhetoric</li>
</ul>
<p>recruit experts. give them clear marching orders. keep them on a leash. fire them if they forget who they serve.</p>
<p><strong>the promise:</strong>
within 10 years, parliament looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>40% working-class background (trades, service, care work)</li>
<li>30% labour organizers and union leaders</li>
<li>30% technical experts (economists, doctors, engineers, scientists)</li>
</ul>
<p>the workers set direction.
the experts build the roads.
together, they deliver for working canadians.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-from-mediocrity-to-excellence">conclusion: from mediocrity to excellence</h3>
<p>canadian politics has become a career for those who want to be politicians, not for those with expertise to govern. we recruit people who want power, not people who want to solve problems.</p>
<p>this must change.</p>
<p>other countries have demonstrated that systematic talent identification, development, and retention can transform governance quality. they recruit their best minds into political service through structured programs, not backroom deals.</p>
<p>canada&rsquo;s advantage: we already produce world-class talent. we just need to keep them home and channel them into public service.</p>
<p><strong>the goal:</strong> within 10 years, canada&rsquo;s political class should be among the most educated, accomplished, and competent in the world. when canadians look at parliament, they should see the best of us, not career politicians.</p>
<p><strong>pragmatic, not performative. outcomes, not actions. surgical, not careless.</strong></p>
<p>this is how we recruit the leadership canada deserves.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="why-recruitment-comes-first-competence-enables-everything-else">why recruitment comes first: competence enables everything else</h3>
<p><strong>the policies outlined below are not impossible. they&rsquo;re just impossible without the right people:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>managing a sovereign wealth fund requires financial expertise, not soundbites about &ldquo;fiscal responsibility&rdquo;</li>
<li>reforming healthcare needs doctors and administrators who&rsquo;ve run hospital systems, not party operatives reading briefing notes</li>
<li>negotiating asian trade partnerships requires deep regional knowledge and language skills, not photo-op diplomacy</li>
<li>building tripartite labour-government cooperation needs people who understand both union organizing and management efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>other countries have executed these policies successfully. the difference isn&rsquo;t resources or systems-it&rsquo;s political leadership quality.</p>
<p><strong>the chicken-and-egg problem:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>without bold policies, talented people won&rsquo;t enter politics (&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo;)</li>
<li>without talented people, bold policies can&rsquo;t be executed (&ldquo;sounds good but won&rsquo;t work&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>policy approach:</strong> recruit simultaneously with policy development. show talented canadians the ambitious agenda, then give them the tools and authority to execute it.</p>
<p>the following sections outline what canada must do. but remember: every policy requires people with expertise to implement it. recruitment isn&rsquo;t separate from governance-it&rsquo;s the foundation of it.</p>

<h3 id="frustration-squandering-our-resource-wealth">frustration: squandering our resource wealth</h3>
<p>canada is one of the richest countries in natural resources, yet we have little to show for it in terms of sovereign wealth. we&rsquo;re the world&rsquo;s fourth-largest oil producer, possess vast mineral reserves, forestry resources, and hydroelectric capacity, yet we continue to accumulate debt rather than wealth.</p>
<p><strong>the current reality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>canada&rsquo;s federal debt sits at over $1.2 trillion (2024)</li>
<li>provincial governments rely on resource royalties for operating budgets, not wealth creation</li>
<li>alberta&rsquo;s heritage savings trust fund, established in 1976, has only $18 billion despite decades of oil revenues</li>
<li>norway, with similar oil production levels, has built a $1.9 trillion fund in a smaller timeframe</li>
<li>we consume our resource wealth instead of investing it for future generations</li>
<li>no coordinated national strategy to convert finite resources into infinite financial assets</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="understanding-norways-success-how-they-built-19-trillion">understanding norway&rsquo;s success: how they built $1.9 trillion</h3>
<p>norway&rsquo;s government pension fund global (gpfg), established in 1990, is the world&rsquo;s largest sovereign wealth fund. here&rsquo;s how they did it:</p>
<p><strong>the norwegian formula:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>disciplined revenue allocation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>all surplus petroleum revenues flow into the fund</li>
<li>the state-owned oil company generates stable government revenue</li>
<li>tax revenues from the oil sector are saved, not spent</li>
<li>the fund owns approximately 1.5% of all global stocks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the sacred fiscal rule</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>government can only spend 3% of the fund&rsquo;s value annually (the expected real return)</li>
<li>this preserves the principal while allowing sustainable withdrawals</li>
<li>protects against political temptation to raid the fund</li>
<li>ensures intergenerational equity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>globally diversified investment strategy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>70% in global equities (not norwegian stocks)</li>
<li>25% in fixed income (bonds)</li>
<li>5% in real estate and renewable energy</li>
<li>professional management by norges bank investment management</li>
<li>ethical investment guidelines excluding weapons, tobacco, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>transparency and governance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>annual public reports on holdings and performance</li>
<li>clear ethical frameworks</li>
<li>independence from short-term political pressures</li>
<li>built public trust through decades of responsible stewardship</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>the result:</strong> norway has accumulated over $360,000 per citizen in sovereign wealth, ensuring prosperity long after oil runs out.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-singapores-three-pillar-system-the-closed-loop">understanding singapore&rsquo;s three-pillar system: the closed loop</h3>
<p>singapore has created an ingenious &ldquo;closed loop&rdquo; system that generates wealth without debt through three interconnected institutions:</p>
<p><strong>pillar 1: central provident fund (cpf) - the domestic savings engine</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>mandatory savings scheme for all working singaporeans</li>
<li>employees contribute 20%, employers contribute 17% of monthly wages</li>
<li>divided into accounts for:
<ul>
<li>retirement (ordinary account)</li>
<li>healthcare (medisave)</li>
<li>housing (can be used for home purchases)</li>
<li>retirement savings (special account)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>earns 2.5-5% interest paid by government</li>
<li>provides stable, low-cost capital for government investment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>pillar 2: temasek holdings - the domestic wealth builder</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>state-owned investment company managing $288 billion (2024)</li>
<li>focuses on domestic and regional investments</li>
<li>owns stakes in singapore airlines, dbs bank, singtel, etc.</li>
<li>operates commercially, seeking market returns</li>
<li>reinvests profits to grow national wealth</li>
<li>acts as active shareholder improving company performance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>pillar 3: gic (government of singapore investment corporation) - the international wealth multiplier</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>manages singapore&rsquo;s foreign reserves ($690 billion estimated)</li>
<li>invests globally in stocks, bonds, real estate, private equity</li>
<li>focuses on long-term returns above global inflation</li>
<li>provides geographic and asset diversification</li>
<li>protects singapore&rsquo;s purchasing power internationally</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>how the closed loop works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>the virtuous cycle:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>cpf collects mandatory savings from workers</li>
<li>government issues special bonds to cpf (singapore government securities)</li>
<li>these bonds pay guaranteed interest to cpf members</li>
<li>the proceeds from these bonds become capital for gic and temasek</li>
<li>gic and temasek invest globally and domestically, earning higher returns</li>
<li>the returns fund government programs and strengthen reserves</li>
<li>no external debt needed because domestic savings fund everything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the key insight:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the government &ldquo;borrows&rdquo; from its own citizens at 2.5-5%</li>
<li>invests through gic/temasek at 6-10% average annual returns</li>
<li>the spread funds government operations without taxation or foreign debt</li>
<li>citizens benefit from guaranteed returns on their savings</li>
<li>the nation builds wealth through professional investment</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s a self-sustaining financial ecosystem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fiscal discipline:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>government operates balanced budgets or surpluses</li>
<li>reserves can only be used for extraordinary circumstances</li>
<li>constitution protects reserves from political raiding</li>
<li>separate roles: cpf for citizens, gic for reserves, temasek for commercial investments</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-albertas-heritage-fund-failed-and-what-we-can-learn">why alberta&rsquo;s heritage fund failed (and what we can learn)</h3>
<p>alberta&rsquo;s heritage savings trust fund was established in 1976 with great promise, inspired by alaska&rsquo;s permanent fund. yet today it has only $18 billion, while norway&rsquo;s fund has $1.9 trillion despite similar oil production timelines.</p>
<p><strong>what went wrong:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>political raiding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>provinces repeatedly withdrew funds for operating expenses</li>
<li>no constitutional protection against political spending</li>
<li>used to balance budgets during downturns instead of being preserved</li>
<li>seen as provincial &ldquo;piggy bank&rdquo; rather than intergenerational trust</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>inadequate contributions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>contributions stopped entirely in 1987</li>
<li>only investment returns (not new revenues) have grown the fund</li>
<li>norway deposits all surplus oil revenue; alberta stopped depositing anything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>poor investment strategy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>early years focused on domestic projects (poorly performing)</li>
<li>not globally diversified like norway&rsquo;s fund</li>
<li>lacked professional management standards</li>
<li>provincial politics influenced investment decisions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>lack of fiscal rule</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>no discipline on when government could spend from the fund</li>
<li>withdrawals not tied to sustainable return rates</li>
<li>political incentives favored spending over saving</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>no federal coordination</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>alberta acted alone, not as part of national strategy</li>
<li>other provinces and federal government didn&rsquo;t participate</li>
<li>resource revenues fragmented across jurisdictions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>the lesson:</strong> institutional design matters as much as resource wealth. without ironclad rules and political will, resource funds fail.</p>
<h3 id="the-canadian-model-combining-norways-discipline-with-singapores-closed-loop">the canadian model: combining norway&rsquo;s discipline with singapore&rsquo;s closed loop</h3>
<p>canada needs both international wealth building (norway style) and domestic wealth creation (singapore style). here&rsquo;s the comprehensive plan:</p>
<h4 id="pillar-1-the-canadian-resource-wealth-fund-crwf---our-norway-style-international-swf">pillar 1: the canadian resource wealth fund (crwf) - our norway-style international swf</h4>
<p><strong>structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>federal sovereign wealth fund investing surplus resource revenues globally</li>
<li>managed by independent crown corporation (arms-length from politics)</li>
<li>diversified across global equities (60%), bonds (25%), real estate (10%), alternatives (5%)</li>
<li>ethical investment mandate excluding weapons, tobacco, fossil fuels (transitioning)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>revenue sources:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>50% of all federal resource revenues (oil, gas, minerals, forestry, hydroelectric)</li>
<li>federal carbon tax revenues after rebates</li>
<li>dividends from government stakes in resources</li>
<li>provincial partnership agreements (provinces contribute 25% of resource revenues)</li>
<li>estimated initial annual deposits: $15-25 billion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>fiscal rule (the sacred covenant):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>constitutionally protected: requires 2/3 parliamentary supermajority to change</li>
<li>government can only withdraw 3% of fund value annually</li>
<li>only usable for:
<ul>
<li>national emergencies (natural disasters, pandemics, war)</li>
<li>infrastructure investments with positive roi</li>
<li>climate transition programs</li>
<li>social program expansion (healthcare, education, housing)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>quarterly public reporting on holdings and performance</li>
<li>independent auditor general oversight</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>target:</strong> $1 trillion within 30 years, assuming 6% average annual returns</p>
<h4 id="pillar-2-the-canadian-prosperity-fund-cpf-yes-like-singapore---mandatory-wealth-savings">pillar 2: the canadian prosperity fund (cpf, yes like singapore) - mandatory wealth savings</h4>
<p><strong>structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>mandatory savings accounts for all working canadians</li>
<li>initial contribution: 5% employee + 5% employer = 10% of gross wages</li>
<li>separate from cpp/ei, focused on wealth building not just retirement</li>
<li>managed by expanded cpp investment board (proven track record)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>account structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>retirement account (50% of contributions):</strong> locked until retirement, invested in balanced portfolio</li>
<li><strong>opportunity account (30%):</strong> accessible for home purchase, education, starting business</li>
<li><strong>health account (20%):</strong> for healthcare expenses (ties into singapore-style healthcare reform)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>key features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>government matches 50% of contributions for earners under $50,000</li>
<li>tax-advantaged growth (like rrsps)</li>
<li>portable across jobs and provinces</li>
<li>inheritable wealth building for families</li>
<li>4-6% guaranteed minimum return (government backstop)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>the wealth multiplication effect:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>average canadian earning $60,000 contributing for 40 years</li>
<li>total contributions: $240,000 (10% × $60,000 × 40 years)</li>
<li>at 5% return: grows to $725,000</li>
<li>creates middle-class wealth without speculation</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pillar-3-canada-development-corporation-cdc---our-temasek-style-domestic-investor">pillar 3: canada development corporation (cdc) - our temasek-style domestic investor</h4>
<p><strong>structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>federal crown corporation managing stakes in strategic domestic assets</li>
<li>operates commercially seeking market returns</li>
<li>professional management, not political patronage</li>
<li>transparent governance with public reporting</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>investment focus:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>strategic stakes in:
<ul>
<li>resource companies (oil, gas, mining, forestry)</li>
<li>infrastructure (airports, ports, rail, telecommunications)</li>
<li>strategic industries (aerospace, technology, pharmaceuticals)</li>
<li>green economy (renewable energy, batteries, clean tech)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>acts as active shareholder improving company performance</li>
<li>ensures canadian ownership of strategic assets</li>

<li>$50 billion federal investment over 5 years</li>
<li>reinvest all profits (no dividends to government for first 10 years)</li>
<li>target: $500 billion portfolio in 25 years</li>
</ul>

<li>prevents foreign takeover of strategic industries</li>
<li>captures resource wealth for canadians, not foreign shareholders</li>
<li>provides patient capital for long-term nation-building projects</li>
<li>generates returns funding social programs</li>

<li>independent professional management</li>
<li>fiscal rule limiting withdrawals to 3% annually</li>

<li>alberta has existing infrastructure (heritage fund)</li>
<li>federal support for expansion: $20 billion one-time transfer</li>
<li>commit to depositing 30% of all oil revenues going forward</li>
<li>target: grow alberta fund from $18 billion to $500 billion in 30 years</li>

<li>canadian workers save 10% of wages → cpf</li>
<li>federal government owns strategic assets → cdc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>wealth multiplication:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>crwf invests globally, earning 6-8% returns</li>
<li>cpf capital managed by cppib, earning 5-7% returns</li>
<li>cdc improves portfolio companies, earning 7-10% returns</li>

<h3 id="conclusion-from-debtor-to-creditor-nation">conclusion: from debtor to creditor nation</h3>
<p>canada faces a choice:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>path 1 (status quo):</strong> continue consuming resource wealth, accumulating debt, leaving future generations with liabilities</li>
<li><strong>path 2 (transformation):</strong> convert finite resources into infinite financial assets, building sovereign wealth that funds prosperity for generations</li>
</ul>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t a fantasy. norway did it. singapore did it. even alaska did it. canada has more resources, a larger economy, better institutions, and stronger democratic foundations than any of these examples.</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve lacked is political will.</p>
<p>the norwegian model teaches us discipline: save the resources, invest globally, spend only returns.</p>
<p>the singapore model teaches us integration: connect savings, domestic investment, and international wealth building into a closed loop.</p>
<p>the alberta heritage fund teaches us what not to do: protect against political raiding, maintain contributions, invest professionally.</p>
<p><strong>this is not partisan politics. this is generational responsibility.</strong></p>
<p>a center-left government should love this: wealth building for all, not just the rich; sustainable funding for social programs; climate transition funding without austerity.</p>
<p>a center-right government should love this: fiscal discipline, debt reduction, market-based returns, individual ownership through cpf.</p>
<p>resource provinces should love this: federal partnership expanding their wealth funds; stabilization during commodity downturns.</p>
<p>young canadians should love this: inheriting wealth instead of debt; affordable housing through cpf; economic opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>the question is not whether we can afford to do this. the question is whether we can afford not to.</strong></p>
<p>every year we delay is another year of resource wealth spent instead of invested. compound returns mean starting in 2025 vs. 2030 changes outcomes by hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>this is canada&rsquo;s chance to join norway and singapore as sovereign wealth success stories. to transform from debtor nation to creditor nation. to ensure that our grandchildren are the wealthiest generation in human history, not the most debt-burdened.</p>
<p><strong>pragmatic, not performative. outcomes, not actions. surgical, not careless.</strong></p>
<p>this is how we build canada&rsquo;s trillion-dollar future.</p>
<h2 id="managing-inflation-through-currency-baskets-not-interest-rates">managing inflation through currency baskets, not interest rates</h2>
<h3 id="frustration-the-blunt-instrument-of-interest-rates">frustration: the blunt instrument of interest rates</h3>
<p>canada&rsquo;s current approach to managing inflation relies almost exclusively on one tool: the bank of canada adjusting interest rates. when inflation rises, the bank increases rates. when the economy slows, they cut them. this approach treats monetary policy like a sledgehammer when we need a scalpel.</p>
<p><strong>the damage of interest rate policy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>housing market volatility:</strong> interest rate hikes disproportionately punish homeowners and aspiring buyers; a 2% rate increase can make a $500,000 mortgage unaffordable for thousands of canadians</li>
<li><strong>transmission lag:</strong> it takes 12-18 months for rate changes to fully impact the economy; by the time effects materialize, economic conditions have often changed</li>
<li><strong>indiscriminate pain:</strong> rate hikes slow all economic activity—punishing productive businesses, killing job creation, and reducing wages—just to cool inflation</li>
<li><strong>wealth concentration:</strong> low rates inflate asset prices (real estate, stocks), enriching existing owners while making wealth-building impossible for younger canadians</li>
<li><strong>external shocks ignored:</strong> when inflation comes from global energy prices or supply chain disruptions (not domestic demand), raising rates does nothing to fix the root cause while inflicting domestic economic pain</li>
<li><strong>political pressure:</strong> the bank faces constant political interference and criticism, undermining its independence and credibility</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>recent failures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2022-2024: the bank kept rates too low for too long, fueling housing speculation and inflation</li>
<li>then overcorrected with aggressive rate hikes that pushed mortgages to unaffordable levels</li>
<li>inflation was driven by global supply chains and energy prices, not canadian consumer demand</li>
<li>yet canadian families paid the price through job losses and unaffordable housing</li>
<li>meanwhile, our dollar depreciated anyway, importing more inflation through higher import costs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>the core problem:</strong> interest rates are a domestic tool attempting to manage an economy exposed to global forces. canada is a small, open economy dependent on trade (imports and exports represent 66% of gdp). we can&rsquo;t control global commodity prices, currency fluctuations, or foreign demand—yet we pretend adjusting interest rates will solve inflation caused by these external factors.</p>
<h3 id="the-alternative-currency-basket-management">the alternative: currency basket management</h3>
<p>instead of trying to control inflation through interest rates, canada should manage the value of the canadian dollar relative to a basket of our major trading partner currencies. this approach targets the root cause of imported inflation while preserving domestic economic stability.</p>
<p><strong>how it works:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. define the basket:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>create a weighted basket of currencies from our major trading partners</li>
<li>suggested weights based on trade volumes:
<ul>
<li>60% us dollar (our largest trading partner)</li>
<li>15% euro (eu is major trade bloc)</li>
<li>10% chinese yuan (rising trade importance)</li>
<li>5% mexican peso (usmca partner)</li>
<li>5% japanese yen (technology and automotive trade)</li>
<li>5% british pound and other currencies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>weights adjusted annually based on actual trade flows</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. target a band, not a fixed rate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the bank of canada maintains the canadian dollar within a target band relative to the basket</li>
<li>example: maintain the cad within ±2% of the basket&rsquo;s weighted average</li>
<li>if the cad appreciates too much (making exports expensive), intervene to weaken it</li>
<li>if the cad depreciates too much (making imports expensive and fueling inflation), intervene to strengthen it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. intervention mechanisms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>foreign exchange operations: buy/sell canadian dollars against basket currencies</li>
<li>adjust bank reserves and liquidity requirements</li>
<li>coordinate with our sovereign wealth fund for large-scale interventions</li>
<li>use forward guidance and communication to shape market expectations</li>
<li>maintain substantial foreign currency reserves (our sovereign wealth fund provides this)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. inflation control through currency stability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>stable currency = stable import prices = controlled inflation</li>
<li>if global energy prices spike, a strong cad cushions the blow for canadian consumers</li>
<li>if trading partners weaken their currencies, we don&rsquo;t automatically import their inflation</li>
<li>exporters get predictable exchange rates for planning and investment</li>
<li>reduces currency speculation and financial market volatility</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-is-superior-to-interest-rate-targeting">why this is superior to interest rate targeting</h3>
<p><strong>reason 1: surgical precision for a trade-dependent economy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>canada imports 37% of what we consume (energy, manufactured goods, food in winter)</li>
<li>interest rates don&rsquo;t control import prices; exchange rates do</li>
<li>managing the currency directly addresses the primary inflation transmission mechanism</li>
<li>example: if oil prices spike globally, a stronger cad means canadians pay less at the pump, even if global prices rise</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>reason 2: protects domestic economic activity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>interest rate hikes kill business investment and job creation to slow inflation</li>
<li>currency management stabilizes prices without destroying domestic economic activity</li>
<li>businesses can invest, hire, and grow even while managing external price pressures</li>
<li>construction, manufacturing, and services sectors aren&rsquo;t punished for global commodity shocks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>reason 3: housing market stability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>interest rates create boom-bust cycles in housing: low rates = speculation and bubbles; high rates = crashes and affordability crises</li>
<li>currency management removes interest rates as housing policy, allowing other tools (taxation, zoning, supply) to address housing directly</li>
<li>mortgage rates can be set by market forces and housing policy, not inflation panic</li>
<li>reduces intergenerational wealth inequality driven by housing speculation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>reason 4: faster transmission and adjustment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>exchange rate changes affect import prices immediately (days/weeks)</li>
<li>interest rate changes take 12-18 months to work through the economy</li>
<li>faster response means less economic damage and more precise control</li>
<li>bank can see effects in real-time and adjust interventions accordingly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>reason 5: export competitiveness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>predictable exchange rates help canadian exporters plan and compete globally</li>
<li>prevents dutch disease: resource booms don&rsquo;t destroy manufacturing through currency appreciation</li>
<li>maintains balance between resource, manufacturing, and service sectors</li>
<li>reduces vulnerability to commodity price volatility</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>reason 6: policy independence from political pressure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>interest rates affect everyone (homeowners, businesses, savers) creating intense political pressure on the bank</li>
<li>currency management is more technical and less visible to average voters</li>
<li>bank faces less political interference while achieving better outcomes</li>
<li>maintains central bank independence while improving results</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>reason 7: compatible with sovereign wealth fund strategy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>our proposed sovereign wealth fund accumulates massive foreign currency reserves</li>
<li>these reserves become ammunition for currency interventions</li>
<li>fund diversification across global assets naturally creates currency flexibility</li>
<li>earns returns while providing monetary policy capacity</li>
<li>(norway&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund provides similar monetary policy flexibility)</li>

<h3 id="overcoming-barriers-to-adoption">overcoming barriers to adoption</h3>
<p><strong>barrier 1: &ldquo;this violates the mundell-fleming trilemma / we&rsquo;ll lose monetary independence&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>reality check:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the trilemma says you can&rsquo;t have: (1) fixed exchange rates, (2) free capital flows, and (3) independent monetary policy</li>
<li><strong>we&rsquo;re not proposing fixed rates:</strong> a ±2% band provides flexibility</li>
<li>canada already lacks true monetary independence: we shadow us federal reserve policy because of trade integration</li>
<li>current system: we pretend to have independence while actually following the fed</li>
<li>proposed system: we acknowledge reality and optimize for stability instead of pretending</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>the pragmatic solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>managed float (not fixed rate) preserves substantial flexibility</li>
<li>capital controls aren&rsquo;t necessary with adequate reserves and credible management</li>
<li>&ldquo;independence&rdquo; that delivers boom-bust cycles is less valuable than &ldquo;coordination&rdquo; that delivers stability</li>
<li>swiss franc management shows you can maintain a band without surrendering independence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>barrier 2: &ldquo;the bank of canada&rsquo;s credibility is built on inflation targeting&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>reality check:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the bank&rsquo;s credibility comes from delivering price stability, not from the specific tool used</li>
<li>inflation targeting only became formal doctrine in 1991; it&rsquo;s not sacred</li>
<li>recent years (2020-2024) showed inflation targeting failed: inflation spiked, then they overcorrected</li>
<li>credibility comes from outcomes, not orthodoxy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>the transition strategy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>communicate clearly and early: &ldquo;we&rsquo;re evolving to better serve canadians&rdquo;</li>
<li>pilot program demonstrates currency management works alongside inflation targeting</li>
<li>publish research showing superior outcomes for small, open economies</li>
<li>international experts and academics provide intellectual support</li>
<li>success builds new credibility: &ldquo;canada innovated and it worked&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>barrier 3: &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have enough foreign currency reserves&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>reality check:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>canada currently has ~$100 billion in foreign reserves</li>
<li>our proposed sovereign wealth fund will accumulate $400 billion+ within 10 years</li>
<li>this is more than sufficient for currency management</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>the reserve strategy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>phase 1 (years 1-2): manage a narrow band with existing reserves + initial sovereign wealth fund</li>
<li>phase 2 (years 3-5): widen interventions as reserves grow</li>
<li>use forward guidance and communication to reduce need for massive interventions</li>
<li>credible commitment reduces actual intervention needs (markets do the work for you)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>comparison:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>switzerland manages the franc with reserves of <del>$900 billion for 8.5 million people (</del>$105,000 per capita)</li>
<li>canada targeting $300-400 billion for 40 million people (~$7,500-10,000 per capita) is conservative</li>
<li>we don&rsquo;t need to match switzerland&rsquo;s ratio; our larger, more diversified economy requires less intervention</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>barrier 4: &ldquo;financial markets will attack the currency band&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>reality check:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>speculative attacks succeed against countries with weak fundamentals or inadequate reserves</li>
<li>canada has: strong fiscal position, diversified economy, massive natural resources, rule of law, political stability</li>
<li>markets respect credible commitments backed by reserves</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>defensive measures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>substantial reserves make attacks expensive and futile</li>
<li>can temporarily widen bands during extreme volatility (flexibility prevents breaking)</li>
<li>coordinate with allies (us, eu, japan) for swap lines during crises</li>
<li>track record of success deters speculators (they lose money attacking credible regimes)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>historical precedent:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>switzerland successfully defended its franc ceiling for years</li>
<li>china manages yuan without speculative attacks despite capital account restrictions</li>
<li>many countries successfully manage exchange rates with adequate reserves and credibility</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>barrier 5: &ldquo;this is just following china/authoritarian model&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>reality check:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>currency management ≠ authoritarianism</li>
<li>switzerland manages the franc (world&rsquo;s most democratic country)</li>
<li>european central bank coordinates euro policy across democracies</li>
<li>many democracies manage exchange rates successfully</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>the distinction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>we&rsquo;re proposing transparency, quarterly reporting, parliamentary oversight</li>
<li>basket composition and target bands are publicly defined</li>
<li>bank of canada remains independent within clear legislative mandate</li>
<li>this is professional central banking, not political manipulation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>barrier 6: &ldquo;exporters need a weak dollar to compete&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>reality check:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>exporters need a <em>predictable</em> dollar more than a weak dollar</li>
<li>currency volatility makes planning impossible and discourages investment</li>
<li>boom-bust cycles kill businesses: weak dollar attracts investment → appreciation kills competitiveness → businesses fail</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>the compromise:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>basket composition can be set to maintain export competitiveness</li>
<li>band management allows gradual adjustment to economic conditions</li>
<li>predictability enables long-term investment and productivity growth</li>
<li>productivity growth matters more than temporary exchange rate advantage</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>germany and netherlands thrive with strong euro because of productivity</li>
<li>japan manufactures globally despite strong yen (until recently)</li>
<li>competitiveness comes from innovation, efficiency, and quality—not just cheap currency</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>barrier 7: &ldquo;the us federal reserve won&rsquo;t cooperate / they&rsquo;ll see this as manipulation&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>reality check:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the us benefits from canadian stability (we&rsquo;re their largest trading partner)</li>
<li>currency band stabilizes bilateral trade and investment flows</li>
<li>we&rsquo;re not trying to manipulate trade advantages, just manage stability</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>diplomatic strategy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>early consultation with us treasury and federal reserve</li>
<li>frame as &ldquo;managing volatility&rdquo; not &ldquo;gaining advantage&rdquo;</li>
<li>point out this reduces pressure on us-canada trade relations</li>
<li>offer coordination: if usd weakens globally, we adjust band rather than fight it</li>
<li>transparency prevents accusations of manipulation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>precedent:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>us tolerates swiss franc management</li>
<li>us accepts european monetary union</li>
<li>us understands canada&rsquo;s unique position as small, open economy</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="expected-outcomes-and-metrics-1">expected outcomes and metrics</h3>
<p><strong>short-term (years 1-3):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>reduced exchange rate volatility (measure: standard deviation of cad vs. basket)</li>
<li>maintained price stability (core inflation remains 1-3%)</li>
<li>increased business investment (predictable currency reduces uncertainty)</li>
<li>reduced political pressure on bank of canada</li>
<li>housing market stabilization begins (interest rates decouple from inflation panic)</li>

<ul>
<li>demonstrated inflation control through currency management</li>
<li>interest rates set by market forces, reflecting productivity and investment demand</li>

<li>canada establishes new monetary policy model for small, open economies</li>
<li>other countries study and adopt similar frameworks</li>
<li>price stability without domestic economic destruction</li>
<li>intergenerational wealth inequality reduced (housing no longer speculative asset)</li>
<li>sovereign wealth fund and currency management reinforce each other</li>

<li>public support for bank of canada: increase from 55% to 75%</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-this-matters-monetary-policy-should-serve-canadians-not-economic-theory">why this matters: monetary policy should serve canadians, not economic theory</h3>
<p>for too long, canada has followed conventional monetary wisdom designed for large, closed economies like the united states. but we&rsquo;re not the united states. we&rsquo;re a small, open economy where trade equals 66% of gdp, where commodity exports drive growth, where foreign shocks regularly overwhelm domestic policy.</p>
<p>interest rate targeting made sense in the 1990s when trade was less globalized and canada was more domestically focused. it doesn&rsquo;t make sense in 2025 when our prosperity depends on global trade, when inflation is imported through exchange rates, when young canadians are priced out of housing by boom-bust interest rate cycles.</p>
<p><strong>currency basket management is pragmatic monetary policy for canadian realities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>targets the actual source of inflation (import prices) not a proxy (domestic demand)</li>
<li>protects domestic economic activity while managing price stability</li>
<li>uses our sovereign wealth fund for both wealth building and monetary stability</li>
<li>removes political pressure from interest rate decisions</li>
<li>provides exporters the predictability they need to invest and compete</li>
<li>works with our trade-dependent economy instead of against it</li>
</ul>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t radical. it&rsquo;s practical. it&rsquo;s what a sophisticated, trade-dependent economy should do in the 21st century.</p>
<p><strong>pragmatic, not performative. outcomes, not actions. surgical, not careless.</strong></p>
<p>this is how we manage a modern canadian economy.</p>

<h3 id="frustration-reflexive-alignment-without-strategic-thinking">frustration: reflexive alignment without strategic thinking</h3>
<p>for too long, canadian foreign policy has operated on autopilot: whatever washington does, ottawa follows. this isn&rsquo;t partnership, it&rsquo;s subordination. and it&rsquo;s cost us credibility, opportunities, and our moral standing on the world stage.</p>
<p><strong>the iraq war was canada&rsquo;s finest hour in modern foreign policy</strong></p>
<p>jean chrétien made the right call in 2003. while tony blair in the uk and john howard in australia rushed to join george w. bush&rsquo;s &ldquo;coalition of the willing,&rdquo; chrétien said no. not because he was anti-american, not because he was naive about hussein&rsquo;s brutality, but because the case for war was weak, the intelligence was questionable, and the consequences were predictable.</p>
<p>history proved him right. iraq descended into chaos. hundreds of thousands died. isis emerged from the power vacuum. trillions of dollars were wasted. and the so-called weapons of mass destruction never existed.</p>
<p><strong>what canada gained from staying out:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>credibility with the global south and middle east</li>
<li>moral authority on international law and un processes</li>
<li>domestic unity (no canadian soldiers died in an unjust war)</li>
<li>fiscal savings (avoided a multi-billion dollar quagmire)</li>
<li>diplomatic independence (showed canada thinks for itself)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>what canada lost from staying out:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>temporary friction with the bush administration</li>
<li>pearl-clutching from the national post editorial board</li>
<li>absolutely nothing of substance</li>
</ul>
<p>this is what principled foreign policy looks like: assessing each situation on its merits, consulting international law, and having the courage to say no to our closest ally when they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<h3 id="policy-deeper-partnerships-in-asia">policy: deeper partnerships in asia</h3>
<p><strong>the current reality (frustration):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>asia is 60% of global gdp and growing</li>
<li>canada&rsquo;s trade with asia lags australia, new zealand, and european competitors</li>
<li>our partnerships are shallow: we talk to japan and south korea, occasionally remember singapore exists, and treat the rest as a monolith</li>
<li>we have no coherent indo-pacific strategy that goes beyond &ldquo;contain china&rdquo;</li>
<li>our universities welcome asian students, then deport them instead of retaining their talent</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>this is strategic malpractice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>and critically: we lack the expertise to fix it.</strong> current canadian diplomacy in asia is conducted by foreign service generalists rotating through postings. we need specialists: people who speak mandarin, japanese, korean; understand regional business cultures; have lived and worked in these countries; maintain personal networks with asian counterparts.</p>
<p><strong>this is why our student retention strategy matters:</strong> canada educates 100,000+ asian students annually. they speak both languages, understand both cultures, have networks in both countries. they&rsquo;re the perfect diplomatic and business bridge-if we stop deporting them.</p>

<li>we charge them full tuition, they spend billions in our economy</li>
<li>they want to stay and contribute</li>
<li>we make immigration needlessly difficult, then deport them</li>
<li>they return home or go to australia/uk/us, taking their skills and canada-trained expertise elsewhere</li>

<p><strong>this is like farming world-class athletes and then giving them to other countries for free.</strong></p>

<li>recognized that syria was unwinnable and focused on refugee support</li>
<li>been tougher on saudi arabia over yemen and khashoggi</li>

<p>canada&rsquo;s greatest foreign policy successes came when we thought for ourselves: chrétien on iraq, pearson creating un peacekeeping, trudeau (senior) recognizing china before the us. our greatest failures came from reflexive alignment: supporting american adventures without strategic thinking.</p>
<p>the 21st century is multipolar and asia-centric. canada can either recognize this reality and build partnerships accordingly, or remain trapped in 20th century atlanticism while the world moves on.</p>
<p><strong>pragmatic, not performative. outcomes, not actions. surgical, not careless.</strong></p>
<p>this means saying no to washington when they&rsquo;re wrong, building deep asian partnerships before our competitors do, and recognizing that canada&rsquo;s security and prosperity depends on a stable, rules-based international order, not on being america&rsquo;s most reliable cheerleader.</p>
<p>chrétien understood this. it&rsquo;s time canadian foreign policy remembered.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion-pragmatic-reform-for-a-sustainable-future">conclusion: pragmatic reform for a sustainable future</h3>
<p>canada&rsquo;s healthcare system requires surgical reform, not wholesale abandonment. the singapore-inspired model offers a path to maintain our commitment to universal access while dramatically improving efficiency and sustainability.</p>
<p>this is not about importing another country&rsquo;s system wholesale; it&rsquo;s about learning from global best practices and adapting them to canadian values and realities. the plan preserves universality while introducing mechanisms that promote efficiency, expand coverage, and ensure long-term fiscal sustainability.</p>
<p>most importantly, this reform is achievable. it requires political courage, federal-provincial cooperation, and public education, but the potential benefits, billions in savings, expanded coverage, shorter wait times, and a sustainable system for future generations, make it imperative.</p>
<p>the question is not whether canada can afford to reform healthcare. the question is whether we can afford not to.</p>
<h2 id="a-stronger-more-centralized-union-partnership">a stronger, more centralized union partnership</h2>
<h3 id="frustration-fragmented-labour-relations-and-missed-opportunities">frustration: fragmented labour relations and missed opportunities</h3>
<p>canada&rsquo;s current labour-political landscape is fragmented and often counterproductive:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>performative over pragmatic</strong>: political parties court union endorsements during elections but fail to integrate labour perspectives into sustained policy-making</li>
<li><strong>adversarial by default</strong>: the traditional labour-management divide creates inefficiencies, prolonged strikes, and policies that lurch between pro-business and pro-labour extremes</li>
<li><strong>missed economic opportunities</strong>: without coordinated planning between government, business, and labour, canada struggles to implement industrial policy, skills training, and productivity improvements</li>
<li><strong>social fragmentation</strong>: weak labour institutions and declining union membership have contributed to rising inequality and economic insecurity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="understanding-the-singapore-success-story">understanding the singapore success story</h3>
<p>singapore has achieved something remarkable: a decades-long partnership between its ruling people&rsquo;s action party (pap) and the national trades union congress (ntuc) that has delivered economic growth, industrial harmony, and rising living standards without the labour-management antagonism that characterizes many western democracies.</p>
<p><strong>key features of the pap-ntuc relationship:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>institutional integration</strong>: since 1961, ntuc leaders have held positions within the pap&rsquo;s leadership structure. the ntuc secretary-general typically serves as a cabinet minister, ensuring labour&rsquo;s voice is at the highest levels of government decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>tripartite cooperation</strong>: singapore&rsquo;s model isn&rsquo;t just government-union cooperation, it&rsquo;s a three-way partnership between government, employers, and unions. this tripartite system has been crucial for implementing labour policies that balance competitiveness with worker welfare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>shared goals, not adversarial politics</strong>: rather than positioning unions as antagonists to government or business, the model treats all parties as partners working toward shared objectives: economic growth, job creation, and improved living standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>legislative enablement</strong>: the pap government has enacted supportive legislation, such as the singapore labour foundation (1977), that institutionalizes union development and worker welfare within the national framework.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="policy-the-canadian-labour-government-partnership">policy: the canadian labour-government partnership</h3>
<h4 id="phase-1-institutional-foundation-years-1-2">phase 1: institutional foundation (years 1-2)</h4>
<p><strong>action 1: create the canadian labor-government partnership council (clgpc)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>establish a statutory body comprising representatives from major federal labour organizations (clc affiliates, public sector unions, independent unions), the governing party&rsquo;s economic policy team, and employer associations</li>
<li>unlike advisory bodies, the clgpc would have formal input into labour legislation, economic policy, and social program design</li>
<li>mandate quarterly meetings with cabinet-level participation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>action 2: integrated leadership appointments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>designate a cabinet position: minister of labor and worker prosperity, who maintains active ties with labour organizations</li>
<li>create &ldquo;labor fellows&rdquo; positions: union leaders serve 2-3 year terms embedded in government ministries (employment, innovation, finance) to provide real-time worker perspectives on policy development</li>
<li>establish reciprocal positions: government policy experts serve as advisors to major unions, fostering mutual understanding</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>action 3: legislative framework</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>pass the &ldquo;labor partnership act&rdquo; enshrining:
<ul>
<li>formal recognition of the tripartite partnership</li>
<li>protected consultation periods for major economic and labour policy changes</li>
<li>funding mechanisms for labour education and union capacity-building</li>
<li>dispute resolution mechanisms that prioritize mediation over confrontation</li>

<li>each strategy includes:
<ul>
<li>job creation targets</li>
<li>skills training and transition programs</li>
<li>wage growth benchmarks</li>
<li>productivity improvement initiatives</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>crucially: all parties (government, employers, unions) commit to implementation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>action 5: worker-centered industrial policy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>revamp existing industrial policy programs to include mandatory labour consultation</li>
<li>create &ldquo;prosperity pacts&rdquo; for key industries:
<ul>
<li>government provides targeted support (tax incentives, R&amp;D funding, procurement preferences)</li>
<li>employers commit to wage floors, training investments, and job security provisions</li>
<li>unions agree to productivity improvements and flexible work arrangements</li>
<li>all parties collabourate on automation and technological change</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>action 6: integrated social programs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>redesign ei, pension, and training programs through tripartite consultation</li>
<li>establish union-administered worker development funds (similar to singapore&rsquo;s skillsfuture)</li>
<li>create portable benefits tied to individuals rather than employers, with union involvement in program governance</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="phase-3-cultural-transformation-years-4-10">phase 3: cultural transformation (years 4-10)</h4>
<p><strong>action 7: shift from adversarial to collabourative culture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>fund joint labour-management training programs in collabourative problem-solving</li>
<li>establish &ldquo;innovation labs&rdquo; where unions and employers co-develop solutions to workplace challenges</li>
<li>reward companies that demonstrate sustained labour-management cooperation with preferential government contracts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>action 8: expand union reach and relevance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>move toward sectoral bargaining (as in europe) where agreements cover entire industries, increasing union relevance</li>
<li>support unions in developing non-traditional services: financial planning, entrepreneurship support, gig worker advocacy</li>
<li>encourage unions to operate social enterprises (following ntuc&rsquo;s model with fairprice cooperatives)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>action 9: transparency and accountability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>publish annual &ldquo;labor partnership report cards&rdquo; tracking:
<ul>
<li>wage growth by sector</li>
<li>industrial dispute rates</li>
<li>worker satisfaction metrics</li>
<li>productivity improvements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>create independent oversight to ensure the partnership serves workers, not just political or union leadership</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-this-solves-the-elite-experts-vs-working-class-movement-tension">how this solves the &ldquo;elite experts vs. working-class movement&rdquo; tension</h3>
<p>this tripartite partnership is where theory meets practice. it&rsquo;s the institutional mechanism that ensures working-class voices drive policy while experts handle implementation.</p>
<p><strong>the power structure:</strong></p>
<p><strong>working-class representation has formal veto power:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>the labour caucus within government:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>minimum 30% of elected mps must have working-class backgrounds (union members, trades workers, nurses, teachers, retail workers)</li>
<li>these mps form a labour caucus with collective bargaining power within the party</li>
<li>major economic and social policy requires labour caucus approval</li>
<li>not just symbolic; they can block proposals that don&rsquo;t serve workers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the clgpc has statutory policy authority:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>not just advisory; policies affecting workers require clgpc sign-off</li>
<li>union representatives outnumber government reps 2:1 in labour policy decisions</li>
<li>economic policy requires consensus, not just government diktat</li>
<li>if clgpc says no, government must revise or abandon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>community policy councils have direct input:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>regional councils comprising union locals, tenant associations, worker co-ops</li>
<li>meet quarterly with cabinet ministers (not just staff)</li>
<li>propose policy priorities that must be addressed</li>
<li>provide report cards on whether policies are actually helping workers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>concrete examples: how policy is actually made</strong></p>
<p><strong>example 1: sovereign wealth fund design</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>elite expert proposes:</strong> &ldquo;let&rsquo;s build a trillion-dollar fund like norway&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>labour caucus responds:</strong> &ldquo;good idea, but how does this help workers today?&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>expert refines:</strong> &ldquo;fund returns pay for expanded social programs within 10 years&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>union reps ask:</strong> &ldquo;what if markets crash? we can&rsquo;t wait 10 years&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>expert adds:</strong> &ldquo;okay, we frontload housing subsidies and childcare now, backfill with returns later&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>community councils weigh in:</strong> &ldquo;we want mandatory savings accounts we control, not just government fund&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>final policy:</strong> combines expert fund management + worker-controlled accounts + immediate benefits</li>
<li><strong>result:</strong> workers drive the &ldquo;what&rdquo; (we want security and wealth), experts handle the &ldquo;how&rdquo; (here&rsquo;s the fund structure)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>example 2: automation and job transition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>tech expert proposes:</strong> &ldquo;we need to automate manufacturing to stay competitive&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>union stops it:</strong> &ldquo;not without worker protection&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>tripartite negotiation begins:</strong>
<ul>
<li>employers: &ldquo;we need automation or we go bankrupt&rdquo;</li>
<li>unions: &ldquo;workers need job security and retraining&rdquo;</li>
<li>government: &ldquo;we can fund transition programs&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>prosperity pact emerges:</strong>
<ul>
<li>companies get r&amp;d tax credits for automation</li>
<li>workers get 2-year paid retraining (full salary) before any layoffs</li>
<li>unions help design new job classifications in automated facilities</li>
<li>government funds training programs and temporary income support</li>
<li>workers who can&rsquo;t retrain get early retirement packages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>result:</strong> automation happens, but workers protected and involved in decisions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>example 3: healthcare reform</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>health economist proposes:</strong> &ldquo;mixed financing like singapore saves billions&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>nurses union objects:</strong> &ldquo;sounds like privatization, how does this help us?&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>clgpc consultation process:</strong>
<ul>
<li>unions bring healthcare workers to testify: nurses, psws, doctors, janitors</li>
<li>workers identify real problems: understaffing, burnout, low wages, not system structure</li>
<li>economist realizes: efficiency savings must go to worker wages and hiring, not just government revenue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>policy revised:</strong>
<ul>
<li>yes to mixed financing efficiency</li>
<li>but: all savings above 50% must go to healthcare worker wages and hiring</li>
<li>union representation on provincial health authority boards</li>
<li>staffing ratios legislated (not just guidelines)</li>
<li>no privatization of hospitals, only clinics under strict regulation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>result:</strong> system more efficient, workers better paid and protected, quality improves</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>the institutional checks on elite power:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. formal representation requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>party executive committee: 40% must be current/former union members</li>
<li>policy committees: labour reps minimum 30%</li>
<li>cabinet: minister of labour must have union background or labour caucus approval</li>
<li>crown corporations: worker representatives on boards</li>
<li>no major policy without labour sign-off</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. transparency and accountability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>all clgpc meetings have public minutes</li>
<li>community policy councils publish quarterly reports grading government</li>
<li>labour caucus can call public votes forcing mps to declare position</li>
<li>workers can see exactly who&rsquo;s serving them and who&rsquo;s not</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. electoral consequences:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>unions control significant voting blocks and can withdraw support</li>
<li>labour caucus can threaten to vote against government on confidence matters</li>
<li>community councils can primary sitting mps in nominations</li>
<li>workers maintain ultimate power: elect new representatives if betrayed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. cultural shift through recruitment:</strong>
remember: 50% of our scholarship students come from working-class families. these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>children of auto workers, now studying economics</li>
<li>children of nurses, now learning healthcare administration</li>
<li>children of truck drivers, now becoming engineers</li>
<li>children of retail workers, now studying law</li>
</ul>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting elite education, but they remember where they came from. they bring working-class values into expert roles.</p>
<p><strong>the analogy refined:</strong></p>
<p>traditional left: &ldquo;workers should make all decisions&rdquo; (populism without expertise)
traditional liberals: &ldquo;experts should make all decisions&rdquo; (technocracy without democracy)</p>
<p><strong>our model:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>workers hold the steering wheel (political priorities and veto power)</li>
<li>experts read the map and handle the engine (technical implementation)</li>
<li>regular check-ins: &ldquo;are we going where you want?&rdquo; (community councils, clgpc, labour caucus)</li>
<li>workers can grab the wheel anytime (formal veto power)</li>
<li>and fire the navigator if they&rsquo;re lost (electoral consequences)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>this is democratic socialism in practice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>workers have structural power through unions and formal representation</li>
<li>policy must serve working-class interests or it doesn&rsquo;t pass</li>
<li>experts are employees of the working-class movement, not its leaders</li>
<li>results matter: if workers aren&rsquo;t better off, the system failed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>the promise:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>sovereign wealth funds designed by wall street experts, governed by union oversight, benefiting all workers</li>
<li>healthcare reformed by medical professionals, at labour&rsquo;s direction, prioritizing worker access and pay</li>
<li>asian trade deals negotiated by diplomats, but unions veto anything that hurts canadian workers</li>
<li>tech policy designed by engineers, but community councils ensure it serves neighbourhoods</li>
</ul>
<p>elite expertise serving working-class priorities through democratic institutions with formal worker power.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you build a working-class movement with expert implementation.</p>
<h3 id="the-case-for-this-approach-pragmatism-over-ideology">the case for this approach: pragmatism over ideology</h3>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t about creating a corporatist state or undermining union independence. it&rsquo;s about recognizing that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>workers need a seat at the table</strong>: real power, not just consultation theatre (and we&rsquo;ve given them formal veto power)</li>
<li><strong>economic growth requires cooperation</strong>: no economy has thrived through prolonged labour-management warfare</li>
<li><strong>canada faces structural challenges</strong>: aging population, climate transition, technological change, these require coordinated planning, not political point-scoring</li>
<li><strong>democratic socialism means democratic planning</strong>: workers should help shape economic policy, not just react to it (and this system gives them actual governance power)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="expected-outcomes">expected outcomes</h3>
<p><strong>short-term (2-5 years):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>reduced strike days and industrial disputes</li>
<li>faster implementation of economic transition programs (green economy, automation adaptation)</li>
<li>improved job quality metrics (wages, benefits, security)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>medium-term (5-10 years):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>higher labour productivity growth</li>
<li>greater income equality (as labour has structural input into wage and social policy)</li>
<li>increased union membership and worker engagement</li>
<li>more resilient economy through cooperative planning</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>long-term (10+ years):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>cultural shift from adversarial to collabourative labour relations</li>
<li>sustained economic competitiveness paired with rising living standards</li>
<li>model becomes self-reinforcing as all parties see benefits</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="addressing-concerns-1">addressing concerns</h3>
<p><strong>&ldquo;this gives too much power to unions&rdquo;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the tripartite model includes employers and government, providing balance</li>
<li>accountability mechanisms and public reporting prevent capture by any single party</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&ldquo;unions will become tools of the government&rdquo;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>unions retain independence; this is partnership, not subordination</li>
<li>strong legislative protections for union autonomy and collective bargaining rights</li>
<li>success depends on unions maintaining credibility with members</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&ldquo;this is un-canadian/undemocratic&rdquo;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>canada already has informal labour-party ties (clc-ndp relationship)</li>
<li>this simply makes existing relationships more transparent and effective</li>
<li>democratic legitimacy comes from all parties winning through cooperation, not power struggles</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&ldquo;singapore is authoritarian; this won&rsquo;t work in a democracy&rdquo;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>tripartite cooperation exists in many democracies (germany, netherlands, austria)</li>
<li>we adopt the institutional mechanisms, not singapore&rsquo;s political system</li>
<li>strong unions require democracy; this model empowers workers within democratic structures</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-from-rhetoric-to-reality">conclusion: from rhetoric to reality</h3>
<p>for too long, canadian politics has treated labour relations as a zero-sum game. progressives promise to &ldquo;stand with workers&rdquo; while conservatives promise to &ldquo;support businesses,&rdquo; and actual workers and businesses suffer through policy whiplash and ideological posturing.</p>
<p>the pap-ntuc model offers a different path: pragmatic collabouration that delivers outcomes, not actions; results, not rhetoric. it&rsquo;s time canada moved beyond performative politics and built institutions that actually serve working canadians.</p>
<p>this is democratic market socialism in practice, not through worker control of the means of production, but through worker partnership in economic governance. not revolution, but evolution toward an economy that works for everyone.</p>
<p>singapore achieves high rates of home ownership, health care access, and education quality, yet maintains relatively high income inequality, ranking very low on global measures of willingness to reduce inequality via taxation and transfers.</p>
