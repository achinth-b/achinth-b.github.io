        <p>Zohran Mamdani is the mayor-elect for New York City.</p>
<p>I had my doubts that he was going to win. It was unfathomable to me that a financial centre so focused on the idea of <em>winning</em> (in the capitalist sense) was capable of entertaining a democratic socialist. I stand happily corrected, and extremely proud that he has won the election. His win and agenda <strong>here</strong> are a paradigm shift of the priorities of the electorate. So, I think the first question to as is: What changed?</p>
<p>The answer lies in who benefits from economic growth. When asset prices rise faster than wages - when homeownership becomes a lottery ticket rather than a milestone, when stock portfolios outpace paychecks - voters notice. They feel it in their rent, their grocery bills, their inability to save. Mamdani&rsquo;s victory signals that electorates are rejecting an economy that rewards proximity to capital over contribution to productivity.</p>
<p>At least, in the advanced, industrialized nations, it&rsquo;s a start to moving away from asset-price boosterism, and towards broadened economic security. Across advanced democracies, elections have swung on cost-of-living and economic security, not just culture-war abstractions. In 2024-25 alone, the cost-of-living crisis dominated voter concern in Canada, UK, Netherlands, etc.  <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> America (and by extension, New York City) are no different; when people feel priced out of basic stablity and ownership, they will <em>always</em> choose candidates who will promise to reroute these gains. This is why populists win! But,  I digress.</p>
<p>This &lsquo;vibe&rsquo; of feeling like you&rsquo;re priced out of your own economy - it has a name.</p>
<h2 id="the-cantillon-effect">The Cantillon Effect</h2>
<p>When new money is created, it doesn&rsquo;t fan out to everyone at once. It enters through the financial system first. Central banks buy government bonds and other assets from trading counterparties-big words for &ldquo;big financial institutions.&rdquo; Not because governments need their cash, but because central banks are <em>required</em> to operate through authorized market‑making counterparties in these markets; that legal and operational design makes large financial institutions the first recipients when new money enters the system. Think of it like opening a faucet at the top of a building: the penthouse gets the water pressure before the lower floors. The first splash lifts the price of what’s being bought (safe bonds), which pushes their yields down; then the sellers and other investors, now earning less on safe assets, reach for alternatives with higher returns - corporate bonds, stocks, real estate, even private credit. In plain terms: the central bank’s buy pushes the bond’s price up and leaves the seller holding cash instead of that bond; with safe returns now lower, that cash goes looking for a new home. In Gary Stevenson’s frame: when extra cash chases things you can’t quickly make more of - houses, prime land, established equities-their supply is slow and demand relatively inelastic, so the new money mostly bids up prices rather than output. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> That “portfolio rebalancing” bids up asset prices now, while wages adjust slowly, if at all. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why them, and not us?</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Central banks implement policy by buying securities from primary dealiers and large isntitions - their operational counterparties - not from household 401ks, pensions, etc.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;rebalancing of the portfolio&rdquo; channel pushes investors out of safe bonds and into risk assets, lifting stock and real-estate prices before wages catch up.</li>
<li>Asset managers&rsquo; first touch shows up as higher asset values and <em>cheaper</em> corporate funding (thanks to lowered interest rates), not instantly as higher wages for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-the-money-does-and-doesnt-go-assets-outrun-incomes">Where the money does (and doesn&rsquo;t) go: assets outrun incomes</h2>
<p>When assets beat earnings, wealth concentrates at the top (those who own more assets), and younger households get stuck with this &rsquo;negative capital&rsquo; - student debt, housing debt, costs of groceries, etc. - which runs away from their purchasing power. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  The middle class is squeezed by shelter and essential services.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t some bullshit abstract. Surveys show young adults naming the cost of living as their top issue, and trust falling when they feel the economy works for someone <em>else</em> first. <sup id="fnref2:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Even some of capitalism&rsquo;s biggest boosters have noticed: when a generation carries debt while being locked out of ownership, they will turn against a system that they have no stake in.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-this-make-people-sour-on-capitalism">Why does this make people sour on &ldquo;capitalism&rdquo;?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The curent financial system&rsquo;s plumbing privileges asset owners: the first beneficiaries are dealers, banks, and large instittions that sell assets to central banks ror raise money cheaply on capital markets. <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These benefits arrive via asset prices first, and not wages or broad consumer demand. <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the time money &rsquo;trickles down&rsquo;, prices have already adjusted upwards; late receivers lose their purchasing power. This is why we feel that the ladder is being pulled up; even if the GDP looks fine and growing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="so-how-do-we-flip-this-first-recipient-democratic-socialism">So, how do we flip this first-recipient? Democratic socialism.</h2>
<p>If the problem is who gets the benefits first, the fix is to <em>change</em> this channel.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Housing first - not asset prices: socialized or public housing and tenant protections stabilize shelter costs, which weakens the asset-inflation channel. <sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> <sup id="fnref3:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Evidence-rich modesl (e.g. Vienna, Singapore) show large public supply keeps prices tethered to wages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public power and mission-driven investment: New Yrok&rsquo;s Build Public Renewables act authorizes the state power authority to build and sell clean power directly, with labour standards - public produvtion that routes benefits to ratepayers and workers instead of just sharehodlers. <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Labour institions: sectoral standards and collective bargaining shift income toward wages - so gains show up in paycheques, not just portfolios. <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smart redistribution: from the IMF&rsquo;s own work, typical redistribution  isn&rsquo;t growth-negative and can even extend expansions -which undercuts the idea that equity is a trade-off.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Zohran&rsquo;s platform sits squarely in this lane: rent relief / socialized housing blunt the asset channel, stronger labour standards ensure gains arrive as income and not just asset marks.</p>
