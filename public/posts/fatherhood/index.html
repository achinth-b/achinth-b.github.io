        <p>I was raised, and have good parents. My father is the best father in the world.</p>
<p>I have the greatest examples of ideal parenting from my mother and father. If I can be half as good as a parent as they collectively were; then I think any child I raise would grow to being a formidable, self-sufficient and healthy adult. So why do I think I wouldn&rsquo;t make for beign a good father? I went and asked my own - and he said (paraphrased from Kannada):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;There will come many times when you will be faced with a crossroads. One road takes you to a place where you will be happy. The other will take you to a place that is right for your child. A good parent is the one who will always choose the road that is right for their child given all variables that are in their control; even at the cost of sacrificing their own potential happiness.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="the-crossroads">The crossroads</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to paint many things as zero-sum. But I find it difficult to hold that premise while simultaneously believing in the truth that you need to make choices in your life; and you&rsquo;ve got to live by them, &amp; consequently, die by those choices. You can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too.</p>
<h2 id="new-york-vancouver-and-the-math-that-doesnt-add-up">New York, Vancouver, and the math that doesn&rsquo;t add up</h2>
<p>I love living in New York City. As much as I have desired to return, I found (and still do find) Vancouver stifling in many aspects - including but not limited to: projected income floor, lucrative career opportunity networks, better ultimate, better social scenes, etc. I would love to raise a child in Williamsburg, or Park Slope, or Prospect Heights, or Fort Greene. I take a lot of pride in this city when I see 10 year olds on the subway going to and from their middle schools. I think if you put young, impressionable minds in a busy place with limitless opportunities and social interactions at every corner, they will come to understand how the world works and build their abilities of comparing and contrasting.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s <em>fucking expensive</em> to raise a child in New York (or my hometown of Vancouver) <em>comfortably</em>. Forget wanting a place that&rsquo;s big enough to raise a family of four in a condo (which, by the way, in a neighbourhood <em>I want</em>, will cost at least <a href="https://streeteasy.com/for-sale/nyc/type:D1,X%7Carea:137,302,304,319,326%7Cbeds:3%7Cbaths%3E=2%7Cin_rect:40.636,40.679,-74.013,-73.944?sort_by=price_asc">$1.2 million</a>). It seems the only reliable method to secure family-driven home ownership (a la the late 1990s to the early 2000s) is to <em>literally</em> become housepoor.</p>
<p>I am someone who hates the idea of leasing and debt. I want to reasonably be in a position where I can buy a home with as little debt as possible because <em>I <em>hate</em> making other people (read: private equity and the big banks) richer off of my hard-earned and priivleged dollars.</em>
I want my wealth to take care of my loved ones and my country, not some billionaire who has the ability to purchase my tranche of some securitized product derived from my credit and mortgage payments because they&rsquo;re deemed as an UHNWI.</p>
<p>And I still want to live here because of how enriching it&rsquo;s made my life! I couldn&rsquo;t be more excited for what the city has in store for me in the next ten, twenty, thirty years!  Reasonably so, if I want to manage raising a family, the more ideal situation would be to go to a place that&rsquo;s cheaper which entails living in a place you&rsquo;re not excited about living in. This is quite literally the conflict between making a choice that&rsquo;s right for your children and making a choice that will make you happy. Living in New York would make me happy, but being in a position to set up my children for success given the stability that I can provide for them would entail leaving.</p>
<h2 id="the-tension-between-wanderlust-and-stability">The tension between wanderlust and stability</h2>
<p>I also want to live and work in many places in the world. I want to build a base both in Vancouver and in New York City, but I also want to spend my time working and living in different places in the world.</p>
<h2 id="the-socio-biological-window-is-closing">The socio-biological window is closing</h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak to other individuals, but I can speak to my life before I graduated university; which I think was pretty standard for a middle-class Canadian life. I finished high school just before I turned 18, and after five years in university, started my first full-time job as soon as I turned 23. Conversely, my partner finished her degree in four years. Both of us, being born in 2000, are twenty-five years old as of today. We make good money and are are capable of making more money in the future.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s ground this in some biological truths. Female fertility drops heavy after the late 20s, which reasonably leaves until the age of 32 or 33 to have a baby with little to no difficulty. Male sperm motility has also shown to have a consequentual drop.</p>
<p>This reasonably gives us about 7 years before the window is going to be closed.</p>
<p>I think it was improtant to dreaw this up because I wanted to amke sure that</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t imagine having seven years of my life to do all the things that I wanted to do - build a company, travel the world, compete (hopefully nationally) in serious high-level ultimate and expect to have all of that done by 32 when I feel like my life has barely just begun.</p>
<p>Children need their parent sto also be there for them.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the other thing - I need to have enough money to set themselves up for their own lives. To tie it back to my hypothetical children&rsquo;s own life choices, I would want them to be educated in one of four Canadian universitites (Waterloo, McGill, British Columbia or Toronto), or a top 10 state school in the US, or a worthwile private degree-granting institytion. Assuming a 10% increase in inflation annually, even if I had kids by 32; by 50 - their RESPs or their</p>
<p>The cost of tuition has been isnane. I can&rsquo;t imagine being forced to feel limited</p>
<ul>
<li>the poiunt about them not attending schools in NYC because pubic school demographics sucl -&gt; with the advent of the ipad kid gernation (don&rsquo;t blame parents, understand their rpedicament) -&gt; don&rsquo;t want my kid to be in that situation</li>
</ul>
<p>so it&rsquo;s either suburbrs or private schools which nruture a high degree of intelligence that&rsquo;s market-survivable</p>
<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>
<p>By most markers - great parents who parented me,</p>
