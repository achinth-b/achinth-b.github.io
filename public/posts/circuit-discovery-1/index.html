        <p><em>This is part one of a series of posts about learning biased circuits in vision/language models. I want to publish a paper to ICML at the end of this.</em></p>
<p>Like most people, I don&rsquo;t know anything about this entire sub-field.
It&rsquo;s exhausting, humbling and most of all - exciting to learn something new about how we can understand generative models.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">perplexity</a>, I get to learn what this subfield is. Let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-circuit-discovery-and-how-did-we-get-here">what is circuit discovery and how did we get here?</h2>
<p>Circuit discovery is a technique from mechanistic interpretability which aims to identify and analyze the internals of generative models.
The abstraction tis technique interfaces with is on identifying &lsquo;circuits&rsquo; - or more precisely, pathways through which transformers process information.</p>
<h3 id="contextual-decomposition">contextual decomposition</h3>
<p>One method method of circuit discovery in transformers is &lsquo;contextual decomposition (CD) for transformers&rsquo;. This works by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>recursive computation: CD recursively computes the contributions of all nodes (eg. attention heads, neurons) in the model&rsquo;s computational graph. This means that for each output, the method assesses how much each component controbutes to the output based on its interactions with other components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>equations: this method uses a set of well-defined equations which isolate the contributions of one model feature from another. This allows for a clear understanding of how specific features affect the overall behaviour of the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pruning: after the contributions have been calculated, CD applies a pruning step to removes node that insignificantly impact the output. THis step simplifies the discovered circuit and focuses on the most relevant components.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="advantages-and-disadvantages-of-contextual-decomposition">advantages and disadvantages of contextual decomposition</h4>
<p>Having been evaluated over several circuit evaluation tasks such as indiret object identification and greater-than comparisons, CD has a high degree of faithfulness to the original model&rsquo;s behaviour, replicating its performance for fewer nodes than competing approaches. It also doesn&rsquo;t require manual crafting of examples or additional training, making it applicable across various transformer architectures.</p>
<h3 id="sparse-autoencoders">sparse autoencoders</h3>
<p>Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a specialized type of autoencoder which focuses on learning efficient represntations of data by enforcing sparsity in encoded representations. This works by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>compressing input data into a lower-dimensional representation and a decoder that reconstructs the original input from this representation - with the added benefit of enforcing a sparsity constraint in the latent space by adding it to the loss function (which I just was reminded - is L1 regularization.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>breaking down neural networks into understandable components without requiring labelled examples. Since sparsity is enforced, most noisy variables are ignored as well as irrelevant information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
