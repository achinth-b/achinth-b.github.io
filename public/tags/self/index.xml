      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year, has been the darkest of my life so far. I lost my job. I lost some dear friends. I lost hope. I herniated my back. I moved back home. In the pursuit of the things I accomplished, &lt;em&gt;I forgot who I was supposed to be&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I forced myself to think more about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing here. I started writing my thoughts which felt disgustingly difficult at first. My self-confidence has never been lower, and if I don&amp;rsquo;t get comfortable with myself again, I will end up falling deeper into the hole I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in for the past six months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
