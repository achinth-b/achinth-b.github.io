      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zohran Mamdani is the mayor-elect for New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had my doubts that he was going to win. It was unfathomable to me that a financial centre so focused on the idea of &lt;em&gt;winning&lt;/em&gt; (in the capitalist sense) was capable of entertaining a democratic socialist. I stand happily corrected, and extremely proud that he has won the election. His win and agenda &lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt; are a paradigm shift of the priorities of the electorate. So, I think the first question to as is: What changed?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
