2,"The Market Basket Measure (MBM) is based on the cost of a specific basket of goods and services representing a modest, basic standard of living for a reference family. These costs are compared to the disposable income of families to determine whether or not they fall below the poverty line. For more information on the 2023-base Market Basket Measure, please consult the document <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75f0002m/75f0002m2025003-eng.htm" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> The proposed methodology for the 2023-base Market Basket Measure of poverty (opens new window)</a>."
3,"Rural areas: includes communities with a population of less than 1,000 or with a population density less than 400 persons per square kilometer that are located outside Census metropolitan areas (CMAs) or Census agglomerations (CAs). Population under 30,000 : CAs below 30,000 and population centres below 10,000 persons. Population 30,000 to 99,999 : CAs between 30,000 and 99,999 persons. Population 100,000 to 499,999: CMAs between 100,000 and 499,999. Population 500,000 and over: CMAs with 500,000 or more persons. Specific city name refers to the population within the CMA or CA."
