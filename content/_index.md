here for:

* mechanistic interpretability
* algorithmic bias
* red teaming generative models
* representation engineering
* search

distracted by:

* ultimate
* canadian politics

I care a lot about fairness, steering generative models and discovering their underlying structures and find meaning from them. AI _is changing_ the world, and we better do a good job of ensuring that future is safe.

Among other things, I'm trying to understand if vision models learn racist features and trying to found a startup. In a past life, I focused on a bunch of pursuits which intersect at software engineering and machine learning.
