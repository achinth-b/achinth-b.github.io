title: what does it mean to be Canadian?
---

Last week, I had a riveting discussion for an hour with [Brendan Samek](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/brendan-samek) on the [Build Canada](https://www.buildcanada.com) Discord server. This was arguably the most thought-provoking discussion I've had with _anyone_ in recent memory. 

Brendan, the ever-present host of the call, asked me a two-part question that really got my gears turning. it was a simple one:

> what does Canada mean to you? what does it mean to be Canadian?

Even though I was able to give my visceral, albeit poorly strung, thoughts on the matter, this question forced me to reconcile my relationship with my country, and I'm extremely glad to share with you, the most refined interface I have with my sense of nationalism. 

But before that, I think we need a quick primer on wat it means to be a 'nation', a 'nation-state', a 'post-national state' (which I rejec for us, by the way). 

## what is a nation? 
While there is no conventially agreed upon defintion for what makes a nation (I mean, people literaly fight wars over this), I think the best defintion of a nation is what I have come up with by syncretizing multiple sources: 

> a nation is a politically motivated and organizationally flexible form of social organization where a collective identity has emerged from a combination of shared social features across a given population including but not limited to: language, culture, history, ethnicity, religion, culture, territory or society.  

To me, Canada represents the world's most ambitious and successful experiment in fostering  pragmatic, collaborative and most importantly, non-zero-sum social organization.
