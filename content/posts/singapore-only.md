not to ragebait, but I think this is valid statement. 

I like Wikipedia's definition of a city state:

> an independent, **sovereign** city that serves as the primary hub of poltical ecominc and cultural life within its contiguous terriitory. 

Notice the words 'sovereign', 'independent', 'state', and 'city'. I think there is a strong case here where you must bring the idea of what a 'sovereign state' is. 

> a sovereign state is a state that has the highest authority over some territory, commonly understood to be independent.

This means, that the authority a sovereign state has, needs to be executed, and most-importantly, enforced.
