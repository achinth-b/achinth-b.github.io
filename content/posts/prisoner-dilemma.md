In order to incentivize an outcome from both of the prisoners, this is the decision space they offer to them. Each number here represents the _years_ that they spend in prison.

| *cooperate* | (1, 1)      | (10, 0)   |
| *defect* | (0, 10)      | (5, 5)   |

Therein lies the question - since each one of the prisoners can't talk to another, what is the most optimal decision that they can make? To frame it around the
