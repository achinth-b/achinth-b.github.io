title: Hi!

This year, has been the darkest of my life so far. I lost my job. I lost some dear friends. I lost hope. I herniated my back. I moved back home. In the pursuit of the things I accomplished, *I forgot who I was supposed to be*.

So I forced myself to think more about what I'm doing here. I started writing my thoughts which felt disgustingly difficult at first. My self-confidence has never been lower, and if I don't get comfortable with myself again, I will end up falling deeper into the hole I've been living in for the past six months.

If I don't force myself to start a blog, then I never will. Even though I have an 'about' page, this is a much more in-depth breakdown of the following.

* Who am I?
* What do I care about?
* What do I want to do with my life?

So, here goes. 

* I love statistics, mathematics, represenatation, data and computing (in that order).
* I am (after a long, often [confusing](https://nctr.ca/education/teaching-resources/residential-school-history/), [tumultuous](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/pblctns/lssns-lrnd/index-en.aspx) and [frustrating](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/internment-of-japanese-canadians) relationship with what it meant to be one), a proud [Canadian](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/learn-about-canada/canadians.html). I spent the first seven years of my life in Singapore and had a short stint in India. I lived for a little bit in the United States too.
* I am a cultural Hindu of Indian heritage. I was raised in a *fairly* orthodox [SmƒÅrta Brahmin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smarta_tradition) household.
  * I am [twice-born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvija#The_meaning_of_the_two_births).
  * I was raised in a [vegetarian](https://www.hinduamerican.org/blog/4-things-about-hinduism-and-vegetarianism/) household.
  * I don't consider myself a spiritual person.
* I play ultimate frisbee. I may not be the best at it, but it's given me so much, such as:
  * how to move on from mistakes quickly
  * weighlifting, cardio and agility training
  * some of my closest friends, no matter where I go
* I love playing around with machine learning models and building things on top of them, and perfecting them.
* I have come to the conclusion that algorithmic bias and AI safety are going to be my life project. I don't want the issues that we have from our past and present metaphysical condition to carry to the new advancements we bring in pursuit of a better future.
* I am a civic market socialist democrat. I like free-market economics, and I don't like how we got to this point in the human condition where we allowed ourselves to be exploited more. We need a stronger welfare state to raise the floor of every one of our fellow citizens.
* I haven't made peace with the fact that I want to do it all. Maybe I will get there someday.
* I love trains. I love taking the subway. I love public transit. I love riding my bike wherever it can take me. I despise cars and hate being forced to drive.
* I hate the McMansions that a stereotypical settled-down dream is associated with. I am a [YIMBY](https://www.housingisahumanright.org/what-is-a-yimby-hint-its-not-good/).
